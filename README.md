# Machine Learning Study Notes
##### I summarized the machine learning key knowledge points for better mastering these concepts.

--------------

## Basic Concepts
### Loss Function:
It is a function used to measure the error between our prediction and our goal.

Some Loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MSE), 

### Gradient Descent:
It is a technique used to minimize the loss function. Iteratively, we will change the model parameters based on the gradient descent results.

Prerequisit for Loss function:
1. Deferetiable 
2. Convex
